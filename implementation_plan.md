# Real Estate Investment Analyst AI Agent - Streamlined Implementation Plan

## Note, this plan got deprioritized due to timing

## Week 1: Core Agent & Calculations

### 1.1 Essential Data Models (Day 1-2)
- [x] Keep existing Property, RentalData, ValuationData models
- [x] Focus on FinancialAnalysis model for cap rate calculations
- [x] Simple InvestmentRecommendation model

### 1.2 Search Tools Integration (Day 2-3)
- [ ] Implement WebSearchTool integration for agent
- [ ] Create basic search queries for:
  - Philadelphia rental data by zip code
  - Property valuations
  - Market cap rates
- [ ] Simple result parsing (extract numbers from text)

### 1.3 Financial Calculator (Day 4-5)
- [ ] Core cap rate calculation: NOI / Property Value
- [ ] NOI calculation: Annual Rent - Annual Expenses
- [ ] Philadelphia assumptions (tax rate, vacancy, maintenance)
- [ ] Simple ROI timeline: Property Value / NOI

### 1.4 Single Agent Implementation (Day 6-7)
- [ ] Integrate search → calculate → recommend workflow
- [ ] Basic error handling (fallback to assumptions when search fails)
- [ ] Simple confidence scoring

## Week 2: UI & Basic Functionality

### 2.1 Gradio Interface (Day 1-3)
- [ ] Address input field
- [ ] Display key results:
  - Estimated monthly rent
  - Property value
  - Cap rate
  - Investment recommendation (BUY/CONSIDER/PASS)
- [ ] Show assumptions used

### 2.2 Agent Integration (Day 4-5)
- [ ] Connect Gradio UI to single agent
- [ ] Display search results and confidence
- [ ] Simple progress indicator

### 2.3 Manual Testing (Day 6-7)
- [ ] Test with 3-5 real Philadelphia addresses
- [ ] Validate calculations match manual analysis
- [ ] Fix obvious bugs

## Week 3: Polish & Refinement

### 3.1 Reliability Improvements (Day 1-3)
- [ ] Better search query optimization
- [ ] Improved fallback logic when search fails
- [ ] Basic input validation (address format)

### 3.2 Results Enhancement (Day 4-5)
- [ ] Show sources for search data
- [ ] Basic comparison to market benchmarks
- [ ] Simple explanation of recommendation reasoning

### 3.3 Final Testing (Day 6-7)
- [ ] End-to-end testing with multiple properties
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Demo preparation

## Week 4: Optional Enhancements (if time permits)

- [ ] Basic sensitivity analysis (3 price scenarios)
- [ ] Chat interface for follow-up questions
- [ ] Export simple text report

## Core Architecture (Simplified)

### Single Agent Workflow
```
Address Input → Search APIs → Extract Data → Calculate Cap Rate → Generate Recommendation
```

### Essential Components Only
- `src/agents/real_estate_agent.py` - Single integrated agent
- `src/search/search_tools.py` - WebSearchTool integration
- `src/calculators/financial.py` - Cap rate & NOI calculations
- `src/calculators/assumptions.py` - Philadelphia market assumptions
- `src/ui/gradio_app.py` - Simple input/output interface

### Key Simplifications
- **No complex data visualization** - just show numbers for now
- **No export functionality** - screen display only
- **No comprehensive error handling** - basic fallbacks only
- **No detailed reporting** - core metrics only
- **No extensive testing framework** - manual validation only

## Success Criteria (Minimal Viable Product)
- [ ] Input Philadelphia address → Get investment recommendation
- [ ] Calculate accurate cap rate using search data + assumptions
- [ ] Display confidence in recommendation
- [ ] Complete analysis in under 2 minutes
- [ ] Work for at least 3 different Philadelphia properties

## Focus: Less Code, More Value
- Hardcode Philadelphia assumptions instead of complex configuration
- Use search APIs directly instead of building abstraction layers
- Simple string parsing instead of complex data extraction
- Basic Gradio interface instead of polished dashboard
- Manual testing instead of automated test suites

This gets you a working AI agent that solves your real problem in 3 weeks while learning the tools, without over-engineering.
